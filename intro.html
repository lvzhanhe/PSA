        <h1>What is global warming?</h1>
        <p>
            Global warming is the term used to describe a gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and its oceans, a change that is believed to be permanently changing the Earth’s climate. There is great debate among many people, and sometimes in the news, on whether global warming is real (some call it a hoax). But climate scientists looking at the data and facts agree the planet is warming. The increased volumes of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases released by the burning of fossil fuels, land clearing, agriculture, and other human activities, are believed to be the primary sources of the global warming that has occurred over the past 50 years.
        </p>
        <h1>Goal of our research</h1>
        <p>
            Since global warming is a worldwide issue now, how will plants respond to global warming? What else, we want to figure out things we can do to protect plants and defend against global warming.
        </p>
        <h1>Our protocal</h1>
        <p>
            Each one in our group has searched a lot of information and materials online. After that, We chose three articles which are authoritative and also best related to our topic. You can see our conclutions in Findings Page. Also, there are six pictures posted in Images. They all provid some information and give us some thinking.
        </p>
        <h1>What we will do next</h1>
        <p>
            Definitely, there are also something we can develop in the future. For instance, adding a comment space is a good idea. By doing this, we can hear the voice of different people from different backgrounds. They will share their own experiences and thoughts, which is helpful for our development.
