        <h1 id="f1">No more pollution</h1>
        <p>
            With the fossil fuels being the most used source of energy in today’s world. It has actually been the leading cause in the Global Warming/climate change discussion. With the massive release of CO2 in the air, it causes a rise in global temperatures which alters all environments across the globe. <br><br>However, it is almost humanly impossible to make a complete switch from fossil fuels to green energy like solar power. But we do need to find a way to reduce CO2 emissions into our air. To lower these emissions is to save our environment, our wildlife, and most important our planet. An easy and fast way to get this done is to produce more plants. When a plant goes through photosynthesis, it absorbs CO2 in the air and produces oxygen. So, with the plants, we could potentially reverse or dampen the effects of global warming in a few short years. As well as produce more oxygen to keep up with Earths growing population. Plants will be a vital part in our planets future.

        <h1 id="f2">Global changes affect nutrients taking in</h1>
        <p>
            Plants need several inputs in order to survive and thrive. Water, of course, is essential, as it is for all living things. There are also other three major elements that are essential ingredients to healthy plant growth: potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorous. Each of them performs a different role for the plant, and a good balance of these elements could build up a good soil based for the plants to grow. <br><br>However, the global changes could affect the nutrients which support the plants’ life. The global warming would bring us the effects of altered water availability which could likely cause nutrient loss. Nutrients can be lost from increased erosion or from changes in aridity. Increased aridity can inhibit surface decomposition and nutrient cycling, decreasing plant productivity. Increased erosion during heavy rainfalls can also quickly deplete soil organic material. If the soil is lack for nutrient, the plants would likely to have diseases, grow slowly, or causes death. After that we would loss more plants that are rare species, or even the ones that support our life as daily food. All plants need heathy soil, we should take action to save them from the global warming effects.

        <h1 id="f3">Global changes to ecology</h1>
        <p>
            Anthropogenic climate change affect ecological interactions between species. According to “Global warming and the disruption of plant–pollinator interactions”, if CO2 concentration increase twice, phenological shift reduce the floral resources available to 17- 50 % of all pollinator species, causing as much as half of the ancestral activity period of the animals to fall at times when no food plants were available. This research shows us the influence of global condition to ecology. We must take it seriously and cope with this problem.
